## Milestone 1

### Notebook

For the first milestone, the main code is in the jupyter notebook [1_network_properties.ipynb](./1_network_properties.ipynb)

Use the following command to launch it : `jupyter notebook 1_network_properties.ipynb`

### Python scripts

A few functions were developped in their own function file. These functions can be found in the folder Milestone1_documents.

A few test scripts were also developped. To launch one of these script, from the Milestone1_documents folder, use the following command : `python [name of test script]`

For example :
+ `python ./connected_graph_test.py`
+ `python ./shortest_path_lengths_test.py`
+ `python ./network_properties.py` but for this last one, make sure that the adjacency matrix is in the [data](./data) folder under the name `adjacency.npy`
